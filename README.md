# 2018-SURF-Trajectory-Estimation

2018 SURF of EEE department XJTLU: Trajectory Estimation of Mobile Users/Devices based on Wi-Fi Fingerprinting and Deep Neural Networks



## Background

This 2018 SURF(Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships) project is based on the last year's SURF of [Indoor Localization  Based on Wi-Fi Fingerprinting](http://kyeongsoo.github.io/research/projects/indoor_localization/index.html) and will go deeper in two directions, one is **advanced DNN-based indoor localization** (including CNN-based approaches); the other is **RNN-based trajectory estimation**.
